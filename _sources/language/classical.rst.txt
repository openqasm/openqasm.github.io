Classical instructions
======================

We envision two levels of classical control: simple, low-level instructions embedded as
part of a quantum circuit and high-level external functions which perform more complex
classical computations. The low-level functions allow basic
computations on lower-level parallel control processors. These instructions are likely
to have known durations and many such instructions might be executed
within the qubit coherence time. The external, or ``extern``, functions execute
complex blocks of classical code that may be neither fast nor guaranteed to return. In order
to connect with classical compilation infrastucture, ``extern`` functions are defined outside of
OpenQASM. The compiler toolchain is expected to link ``extern`` functions when building an
executable. This strategy allows the programmer to use existing libraries without porting them into
OpenQASM. ``extern`` functions run on a global processor concurrently with operations on local
processors, if possible. ``extern`` functions can write to the global controllerâ€™s memory,
which may not be directly accessible by the local controllers.

Low-level classical instructions
--------------------------------

Generalities
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All types support the assignment operator ``=``. The left-hand-side (LHS) and
right-hand-side (RHS) of the assignment operator must be of the same
type. For real-time values assignment is by copy of the RHS value to the
assigned variable on the LHS.

.. code-block:: c

   int[32] a;
   int[32] b = 10; // Combined declaration and assignment

   a = b; // Assign b to a
   b = 0;
   a == b; // False
   a == 10; // True

Classical bits and registers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Classical registers and bits support bitwise operators and the
corresponding assignment operators between registers of the same size:
and ``&``, or ``|``, xor ``^``. They support left shift ``<<`` and right shift ``>>`` by an unsigned
integer, and the corresponding assignment operators. The shift operators
shift bits off the end. They also support not ``~``, ``popcount`` [1]_, and left and
right circular shift, ``rotl`` and ``rotr``, respectively.

.. code-block:: c

   bit[8] a = "10001111";
   bit[8] b = "01110000";

   a << 1; // Bit shift left produces "00011110"
   rotl(a, 2) // Produces "00111110"
   a | b; // Produces "11111111"
   a & b; // Produces "00000000"

Comparison (Boolean) Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Integers, angles, bits, and classical registers can
be compared (:math:`>`, :math:`>=`, :math:`<`, :math:`<=`, :math:`==`,
:math:`!=`) and yield Boolean values. Boolean values support logical
operators: and ``&&``, or ``||``, not ``!``. The keyword ``in`` tests if an integer belongs to
an index set, for example ``i in {0,3}`` returns ``true`` if i equals 0 or 3 and ``false`` otherwise.

.. code-block:: c

   bool a = false;
   int[32] b = 1;
   angle[32] d = pi;
   float[32] e = pi;

   a == false; // True
   a == bool(b); // False
   c >= b; // True
   d == pi; // True
   // Susceptible to floating point casting errors
   e == float(d);

Integers
~~~~~~~~

Integer types support addition ``+``, subtraction ``-``, multiplication ``*``, integer division [2]_ ``/``, modulo ``%``, and power ``**``, as well as the corresponding assignments ``+=``, ``-=``, ``*=``, ``/=``, ``%=``, and ``**=``.

.. code-block:: c

   int[32] a = 2;
   int[32] b = 3;

   a * b; // 6
   b / a; // 1
   b % a; // 1
   a ** b; // 8
   a += 4; // a == 6

Floating-point numbers and angles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Floating-point and angle types support addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and power and the corresponding assignment operators.

.. code-block:: c

   angle[20] a = pi / 2;
   angle[20] b = pi;
   a + b; // 3/2 * pi
   a ** b; // 4.1316...
   angle[10] c;
   c = angle(a + b); // cast to angle[10]

Complex numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Complex numbers support addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power
and the corresponding assignment operators.  These binary operators follow
analogous semantics to those described in Annex G (section G.5) of the C99
specification (note that OpenQASM 3.0 has no *imaginary* type, only *complex*).
These operations use the floating-point semantics of the underlying component
floating-point types, including their ``NaN`` propagation, and
hardware-dependent rounding mode and subnormal handling.

.. code-block:: c

   complex[float[64]] a = 10.0 + 5.0im;
   complex[float[64]] b = -2.0 - 7.0im;
   complex[float[64]] c = a + b;   // c = 8.0 - 2.0im
   complex[float[64]] d = a - b;   // d = 12.0+12.0im;
   complex[float[64]] e = a * b;   // e = 15.0-80.0im;
   complex[float[64]] f = a / b;   // f = (-55.0+60.0im)/53.0
   complex[float[64]] g = a ** b;  // g = (0.10694695640729072+0.17536481119721312im)

Evaluation order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenQASM evaluates expressions from left to right.

   .. table:: [operator-precedence] operator precedence in OpenQASM ordered from highest precedence to lowest precedence. Higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

      +----------------------------------------+------------------------------------+


Looping and branching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If-else statements
..................

The statement ``if ( bool ) <true-body>`` branches to program if the Boolean evaluates to true and
may optionally be followed by ``else <false-body>``.  Both ``true-body`` and
``false-body`` can be a single statement terminated by a semicolon, or a program
block of several statements ``{ stmt1; stmt2; }``.

.. code-block:: c

   bool target = false;
   qubit a;
   h a;
   bit output = measure qubit

   // example of branching
   if (target == output) {
      // do something
   } else {
      // do something else
   }

For loops
.........

The statement ``for <type> <name> in <values> <body>`` loops over the
items in ``values``, assigning each value to the variable ``name`` in subsequent
iterations of the loop ``body``.  ``values`` can be:

- a discrete set of scalar types, defined using the
  :ref:`array-literal syntax <types-arrays>`, such as ``{1, 2, 3}``.  Each value
  in the set must be able to be implicitly promoted to the type ``type``.

- a range expression in square brackets of the form ``[start : (step :)? stop]``,
  where ``step`` is equal to ``1`` if omitted.  As in other range expressions,
  the range is inclusive at both ends.  Both ``start`` and ``stop`` must be
  given.  All three values must be of integer or unsigned-integer types.  The
  scalar type of elements in the resulting range expression is the same as the
  type of result of the :ref:`implicit promotion <implicit-promotion-rules>`
  between ``start`` and ``stop``.  For example, if ``start`` is a ``uint[8]``
  and ``stop`` is an ``int[16]``, the values to be assigned will all be of type
  ``int[16]``.

- a value of type ``bit[n]``, or the target of a ``let`` statement that creates
  an alias to classical bits.  The corresponding scalar type of the loop
  variable is ``bit``, as appropriate.

- a value of type ``array[<scalar>, n]``, _i.e._ a one-dimensional
  array.  Values of type ``scalar`` must be able to be implicitly promoted to
  values of type ``type``.  Modification of the loop variable does not change
  the corresponding value in the array.

It is valid to use an indexing expression (e.g. ``my_array[1:3]``) to arrive at
one of the types given above.  In the cases of sets, ``bit[n]``, classical
aliases and ``array``, the iteration order is guaranteed to be in sequential
index order, that is ``iden[0]`` then ``iden[1]``, and so on.

The loop body can either be a single statement terminated by a semicolon, or a
program block in curly braces ``{}`` containing several statements.

Assigning a value to the loop variable within an iteration over the body does
not affect the next value that the loop variable will take.

The scope of the loop variable is limited to the body of the loop.  It is not
accessible after the loop.

.. code-block:: c

   int[32] b = 0;
   // loop over a discrete set of values
   for int[32] i in {1, 5, 10} {
       b += i;
   }
   // b == 16, and i is not in scope.

   // loop over every even integer from 0 to 20 using a range, and call a
   // subroutine with that value.
   for int i in [0:2:20]
      subroutine(i);

   // high precision typed loop variable
   for uint[64] i in [4294967296:4294967306] {
      // do something
   }

   // Loop over an array of floats.
   array[float[64], 4] my_floats = {1.2, -3.4, 0.5, 9.8};
   for float[64] f in my_floats {
      // do something with 'f'
   }

   // Loop over a register of bits.
   bit[5] register;
   for b in register {}
   let alias = register[1:3];
   for b in alias {}


While loops
...........

The statement ``while ( bool ) <body>`` executes program until the Boolean evaluates to
false [3]_. Variables in the loop condition statement may be modified
within the while loop body.  The ``body`` can be either a single statement
terminated by a semicolon, or a program block in curly braces ``{}`` of several
statements:

.. code-block:: c

   qubit q;
   bit result;

   int i = 0;
   // Keep applying hadamards and measuring a qubit
   // until 10, |1>s are measured
   while (i < 10) {
       h q;
       result = measure q;
       if (result) {
           i += 1;
       }
   }

Breaking and continuing loops
.............................

The statement ``break;`` moves control to the statement immediately following
the closest containing ``for`` or ``while`` loop.

The statement ``continue;`` causes execution to jump to the next step in the
closest containing ``for`` or ``while`` loop.  In a ``while`` loop, this point
is the evaluation of the loop condition.  In a ``for`` loop, this is the
assignment of the next value of the loop variable, or the end of the loop if the
current value is the last in the set.

.. code-block:: c

   int[32] i = 0;

   while (i < 10) {
       i += 1;
       // continue to next loop iteration
       if (i == 2) {
           continue;
       }

       // some program

       // break out of loop
       if (i == 4) {
           break;
       }

       // more program
   }

It is an error to have a ``break;`` or ``continue;`` statement outside a loop,
such as at the top level of the main circuit or of a subroutine.

.. code-block:: c
   
   OPENQASM 3.0;

   break;  // Invalid: no containing loop.

   def fn() {
      continue; // Invalid: no containing loop.
   }


Terminating the program early
.............................

The statement ``end;`` immediately terminates the program, no matter what scope
it is called from.

Extern function calls
---------------------

``extern`` functions are declared by giving their signature using the
statement ``extern name(inputs) -> output;`` where ``inputs`` is a comma-separated list of type
names and ``output`` is a single type name. The parentheses may be omitted if there are no ``inputs``.

``extern`` functions can take of any number of arguments whose types correspond to the classical
types of OpenQASM. Inputs are passed by value. They can return zero or one value whose type
is any classical type in OpenQASM except real constants. If necessary,
multiple return values can be accommodated by concatenating registers.
The type and size of each argument must be known at compile time to
define data flow and enable scheduling. We do not address issues such as
how the ``extern`` functions are defined and registered.

``extern`` functions are invoked using the statement ``name(inputs);`` and the result may be
assigned to ``output`` as needed via an assignment operator (``=``, ``+=``, etc). ``inputs`` are
literals and ``output`` is a variable, corresponding to the types in the signature. The functions
are not required to be idempotent. They may change the state of the process providing the function.
In our computational model, ``extern`` functions may run concurrently with other classical and
quantum computations. That is, invoking an ``extern`` function will  *schedule* a classical
computation, but does not wait for that computation to terminate.

.. [1]
   ``popcount`` computes the Hamming weight of the input register.

.. [2]
   If multiplication and division instructions are not available in
   hardware, they can be implemented by expanding into other
   instructions.

.. [3]
   This clearly allows users to write code that does not terminate. We
   do not discuss implementation details here, but one possibility is to
   compile into target code that imposes iteration limits.
